    """Computes one-to-one matching between predictions and ground truth.
    This class computes an assignment between the targets and the predictions
    based on the costs. The costs are weighted sum of three components:
    classification cost, regression L1 cost and regression iou cost. The
    targets don't include the no_object, so generally there are more
    predictions than targets. After the one-to-one matching, the un-matched
    are treated as backgrounds. Thus each query prediction will be assigned
    with `0` or a positive integer indicating the ground truth index:
    - 0: negative sample, no assigned gt
    - positive integer: positive sample, index (1-based) of assigned gt

            cost. Default 1.0.
